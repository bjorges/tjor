# Changelog

All notable changes to tjor. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org);
dates are release dates. Pre-1.0: minor versions may carry breaking changes.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-09-05 — Security fixes (external review round 5)

### Fixed
- **Broker revoke-on-teardown now actually fires.** `tjor down`/`gc`
  previously force-removed the proxy (SIGKILL), so mitmdump's `done()` hook —
  where credential revocation lives — never ran; auto-expiry was the *only*
  revocation. The proxy is now stopped gracefully (SIGTERM + grace) before
  removal so revocation runs on the normal teardown path.
- **`tjor reset creds` now wipes the broker directory** (the GitHub App
  private key, not just the ~1h token) — previously only `reset all` removed it.
- **`tjor reset` TOCTOU hardened.** With persistent containers a live agent
  could race a symlink swap between the ancestor check and the delete; reset
  now refuses a running session (`tjor down` first, or `--force`).
- `broker.json` is created `0o600` atomically (no brief world-readable window).
- Broker teardown reports revoke success/failure accurately instead of
  always logging "revoked".
- GitHub App token expiry parsed as UTC (`calendar.timegm`), robust to `TZ`.
- `tjor attach` field-parses on the same control separator as `ls`/`gc`.
- README summary reconciled with the roadmap table (D2 shipped); a CI
  doc-consistency lint now enforces this structurally.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-05 — Credential broker (D2)
Per-session, short-TTL GitHub credentials injected at the proxy toward
configured hosts only; the agent holds a placeholder and never possesses the
real secret (CI scans a live container to prove it). `github-app` + `pat`
sources, host-scoped and fail-closed, teardown revocation. ADR 0007.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-05 — Security fixes (review round 4)
Critical `tjor reset` symlink-escape across nested tiers; IPv4-compatible
IPv6 SSRF form; session-collision guard; threat-model docs (ADR 0006).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-05 — Session lifecycle (D3)
`ls` (with live boundary re-check), `attach`, `gc`, tiered `reset`, concurrent
named/detached sessions per repo.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-05 — Security fixes (review round 2)
`rawtcp=false` (CONNECT passthrough bypass); version-independent IP guard;
narrowed capabilities.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-05 — Session identity (D1)
Vendor-neutral `x-agent-*` schema; proxy verifies/strips forgeries; opt-in
injection toward configured hosts.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-05
In-cage `gh auth login` fix (official gh binary); brew-ready launcher.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-04 — Cage core
Internal-only network, dual-homed fail-closed egress proxy, DNS zone scoping,
non-root agent, adversarial conformance suite.
