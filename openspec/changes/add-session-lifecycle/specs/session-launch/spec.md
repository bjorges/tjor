## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Agent containers carry discovery labels

Every agent container the launcher starts SHALL carry labels identifying the session (session id, workspace path, harness, task id when set, launch timestamp) so lifecycle tooling never parses container names.

#### Scenario: Labels present on a running agent
- **WHEN** a session is launched
- **THEN** its agent container carries the tjor session labels with the launcher's values

### Requirement: Named session derivation

When `--session <name>` is given (name matching `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,32}`), the session id SHALL be derived from both the workspace and the name; without it, derivation is unchanged (repo-scoped default session).

#### Scenario: Same repo, different names
- **WHEN** sessions `a` and `b` are launched from the same repo
- **THEN** their session ids differ and neither collides with the repo's default session
